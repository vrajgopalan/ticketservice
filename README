Ticket Service
============

This is a sample application for booking tickets. This is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. Read LICENSE for further information.

## Running Tests
## The project has been built using maven (3.2.1) and Java 7
## The project has not been tested on Java 8

For running unit tests, run the following command.
mvn -e test

For running integration tests, run the following command.
mvn -e integration-test

For creating jar file, run the following command:
mvn clean package

NOTE:
The application assumes one "instance" of venue (i.e. venue booked for an event for a certain time) when reserving tickets. The venue_instance table is used to store this instance. Based on interface provided the code works for one venue instance.

The levels for venue are in ascending order of importance (e.g. level 4 = orchestra, level 1 = balcony). When level is not given the highest level is booked first. 

The expiry time of a seat hold is assumed to be one day (24 hours).

Since Java 8 was not available I am using Guava's "Optional" implementation.

The test uses HSQLDB. For running on a container, datasource will have to be configured in application-context.xml. 

TODO:
Move seat hold objects (which expire after certain time) to expiring map (CacheBuilder?). This is to reduce DB hits when getting num of seats etc.
Rewrite native sql query in DAO to named/criteria query. Verify criteria query errors.
Implement more integration tests
